# road-renderer
render and edit roads from an aerial perspective

I want to try to make something like that ⬆️

just to see how far I can get

## Todo
- Fix road connection bugs
- Fix road fill path difference with road line paths
- Change the bounds of roads' interactable depending on road selection state
- Show all position handles if a handle is currently being dragged (so that other roads can connect to it)
- Dynamic sidebar with actions depending on what's selected
- Undo/Redo
