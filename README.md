# road-renderer
render and edit roads from an aerial perspective

I want to try to make something like that ⬆️

just to see how far I can get

## Todo
- Fix road connection bugs
- Widen lines and add some dashed ones in the middle to make it look more like a road
- Only show handles on road hover
- Dynamic sidebar with actions depending on what's selected
- Undo/Redo
